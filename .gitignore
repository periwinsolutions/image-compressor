I understand. You have selected the README content for the Image Transformer Canvas and are requesting a `.gitignore` file for it.

Here is a `.gitignore` file tailored for a project like this, considering the presence of a `.vscode` directory and common dependencies.

```
# Gitignore for a client-side web project

# Build artifacts
/dist
/build
/out

# Log files
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Misc files
.env
.env.local
.DS_Store
```
